Checklist for API Migration:
1. Pre-Migration Checks
✅ Identify and document APIs in the group.
✅ Verify API dependencies and integrations.
✅ Ensure all Kubernetes manifests (YAML files) are ready.
✅ Update and validate CI/CD pipelines for K8s deployment.
✅ Define rollback strategy and test rollback in a non-prod environment.

2. Test Environment (Functional & Performance Tests)
✅ Deploy APIs to Test environment in Kubernetes.
✅ Run full functional tests for all request types (GET, POST, PUT, etc.).
✅ Execute performance tests (latency, throughput, scaling tests).
✅ Compare API behavior in Docker vs. Kubernetes.
✅ Ensure no regression issues before moving forward.

3. Preprod Environment (Token, Kong Config, Services, Monitoring)
✅ Deploy APIs to Preprod environment in Kubernetes.
✅ Validate authentication tokens (ensure they work correctly).
✅ Check Kong configurations (rate limits, routing, security rules).
✅ Verify all API services are deployed and accessible.
✅ Convert POST & PUT requests to GET requests to confirm connectivity.
✅ Ensure API GET responses match expected behavior.
✅ Confirm monitoring and logging are working (Grafana, Prometheus, etc.).
✅ Run end-to-end validation for GET requests.

4. Prod Environment (10% → 100% Rollout)
4.1 Partial (10%) Rollout
✅ Deploy 10% of traffic to Kubernetes using traffic splitting.
✅ Validate token authentication.
✅ Verify Kong gateway configurations are correct.
✅ Confirm services are running and API calls succeed.
✅ Monitor logs, metrics, and alerts for errors or anomalies.
✅ Validate API behavior against Docker deployment for consistency.

4.2 Full (100%) Rollout
✅ Deploy remaining 90% of traffic to Kubernetes.
✅ Reconfirm token validation, Kong configurations, and service availability.
✅ Ensure API is functioning without latency spikes or failures.
✅ Validate monitoring setup and adjust alerts if necessary.
✅ Perform end-to-end testing with real traffic.

5. Post-Migration Validation
✅ Ensure all API traffic is successfully routed to Kubernetes.
✅ Validate scalability and resilience of K8s deployment.
✅ Update API documentation (deployment architecture, configs, monitoring details).
✅ Communicate changes to stakeholders and support teams.
✅ Close the migration story in Jira.

Rollback Plan (If Needed)
✅ Define rollback steps to revert to Docker in case of failures.
✅ Ensure rollback is tested in Preprod before applying in Prod.
✅ Document rollback execution steps and responsible teams.
